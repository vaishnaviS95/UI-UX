Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s),
and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, 
and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

Notes:

- The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.
- Pay attention to the data types.
- If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be 0


Hint: Time = Distance/Speed


Solution:
function leafFall(velocity) {
    return velocity < 1 ? 0 : 400/v; 
}
